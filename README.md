Future Goals:

--  This is an idea. Continuing to develop this idea is currently undecided.  --

This mod is a test to see how MCreator works. My future goals are to add:

    A boss to fight.
    An entire new dimension with lore.
    More custom items.
    A trading system to improve custom gear.
    New enemies.
    More effects.
    More enchantments.
    An array of new blocks.

The basis of the idea is that a massively powerful entity in the Void, a dimension entirely without sun or light, attempted to overtake the Overworld in numerous waves from crevaces leading to the dimension. This invasion failed, due to creatures from the Void dying almost immediately when sun touches their skin.

You, as the player, get to explore this new dimension and learn about the inter-dimensional war that occurred, confront creatures of the Void, and eventually locate this entity and kill it.
